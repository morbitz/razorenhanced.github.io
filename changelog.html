<p>
  <strong>Version 0.8.2.25 [9/13/2022]</strong>
  Serialize UOS scripts. That is, you can start more than 1, but they will only run 1 at a time. 
  If 1 is an endless loop, none of the others will get to run.
  This is because the internal script engine is not re-entrant, so until I fix that this is all I can do.

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Version 0.8.2.5 [8/18/2022]</strong>
  Dramoor noticed CUO modifies some of the itemstatic ids based on what map and season your using.
  This may be why pathfinding was getting stuck on some items, so now we have the CUO static map hack.
  I think the only major change is on the desolate maps like felucca.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Version 0.8.2.4 [8/17/2022]</strong>
  Ooops.. another bug fix.
  This one was replicating Data, so I am sorry. The only fix is to go manually delete the extra script entries (or edit the RazorEnhanced.settings.SCRIPTING file manually (danger make a backup copy before you start)
  Apologies for trouble.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Version 0.8.2.3 [8/16/2022]</strong>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.6.1 [6/19/2020]</strong>
    <br /> ** These changes are backwards compatible. i.e. if you do nothing, everything should work like it did before
    <br />- This should be confusing, a NEW 7.6 .. but the I changed the json to store some extra data so time to rev
    <br />- Added a destination per item in autoloot. This allows you to direct different items to different containers.
    <br />  The old rules still apply, so if the item specific container doesn't exist, it will try you autoloot container,
    <br />  If the Autoloot container doesn't exist, it will drop in your backpack
    <br />- While I was changing autoloot, Kolka happenned to ask if I could add an option to loot while stealthed.
    <br />  So I added it, but it defaults to False.
</p>
<p>

    <br />- Added a null pointer check in autoloot for when someone removes the item after looting has tried to get it
    <br />- Added functions for Items.UseItemOn and (removed) Player.UseSkillOn. After adding these I found only OSI
    <br />  Servers support UseItemOn, and no one supported UseSkillOn. I left them in as they are documented packets
    <br />  but realistic use is limited.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.52 [6/8/2020]</strong>

    <br />- I think I fixed the drag-drop problem CUO users were experiencing
    <br />  The problem appeared to be the dispatch Timer was dieing, and I think it was due to buffer overflow
    <br />  I recommend the object delay on options page never be less than 2X ping speed
    <br />  and the delay after a move should be at about 6X your ping speed
</p>
<p>

    <br />- Add new parameter to Spell.Cast functions to allow target to be passed on single line
    <br />  This uses a single packet to the server, so no targeting needed
    <br />  Older servers will not support this, so will have to use the old cast / wait target / target which still works
</p>
<p>
